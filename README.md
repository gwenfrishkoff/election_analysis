# Election Analysis (using Python)

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has requested that we complete an alection audit to tabulate results from a recent local congressional election. The employee has asked that the following tasks be undertaken to complete the audit:  
	<ol>
	<li> Calculate the total number of votes cast in this election (for all candidates);
	<li> Extract a complete list of the candidates who received votes;
    <li> Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received;
    <li> Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate received; and
    <li> Determine the winner of the election (based on popular vote).
	</ol>

## Resources
To accomplish these tasks, we used the following resources:
	<ol>
	<li> Data Source = 'election_results.csv'; and
	<li> Software = Python (v 3.9.7); Visual Code Studio (v 1.68,1);
	</ol>
We used python to automate the election analysis and to output analysis results to a text (.csv) file.

## Results
The python code that we created resulted in the following outputs (files created):
	<ol>
	<li> Data Analysis Results File = 'election_results.txt'; and
	<li> Python Script = 'PyPoll.py';
	</ol>

## Summary
Analysis results suggest the following conclusions:
	<ol>
	<li> There were 369,711 total votes cast in the election.
	<li> There were three candidates who received votes:
    	<li> Charles Casper Stockham,
        <li> Diana DeGette, and
        <li> Raymon Anthony Doane.
    <li> There candidate results were as follows:
    	<li> Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote (#votes = 85,213);
        <li> Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote (#votes = 272,892); and
        <li> Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote (#votes = 11,606);
    <li> The winning candidate was Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote (#votes = 272,892).
	</ol>
